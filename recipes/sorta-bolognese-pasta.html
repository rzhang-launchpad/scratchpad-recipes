            <li>2 jalape√±os</li>
            <li>bacon</li>
            <li>misc. diced vegetables</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        good options are carrots, cauliflower, etc. You want more fibre? BOOM, it's fibre.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>additional clove of garlic</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dice onion, bell pepper, other optional vegetables into ~1cm cubes</li>
    <li>Using a garlic crusher or by hand, mince garlic</li>
    <li>Heat up large pot on medium heat. Once the pot is hot, put the ground beef into the pot. Cook the ground beef until it is no longer pink.</li>
    <li>Put onion, bell peppers, garlic, other vegetables into the pot. Cook until it's less liquidy.</li>
    <li>Pour in the can of pasta sauce into the pot</li>
    <li>Mix the food in the pot and cover</li>
    <li>Change heat to low and let the pasta sauce simmer, mixing every 10 minutes</li>
    <li>As the pasta sauce simmers, boil some water. Once the water has boiled, add in the pasta noodles, and cook as described in the instructions.</li>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hot tip: if you're prepping your food, leaving the noodles in the sauce can leave em soggy. If you cook the noodles and leave the cooked noodles in a separate container, the noodles will not get soggy. Mix the pasta and sauce the morning/night before your meal</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</ol>
